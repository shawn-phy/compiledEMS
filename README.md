## Description
a repo for holding all the code about the Event management system. 

this repo consolidates the code from three different repos. 
It is a single monorepo structure after each module was completed in its own separate repo. THe modules have been added as submodules to their own individual directories. 

Its a very primitive protoype with no authentication and authorization, I intend on using a service like Auth0 to handle all of those.
